# ü§µüèª About Me
I'm now pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at the School of Power and Mechanical, Wuhan University(Ê≠¶Ê±âÂ§ßÂ≠¶Âä®Âäõ‰∏éÊú∫Ê¢∞Â≠¶Èô¢). Presently, I'm working on a research project supervised by [Prof. Miao Li(ÊùéÊ∑º)](https://miaoli.github.io/). 

I won the National Scholarship in 2021 and 2022 and was selected as one of the "Top 10 Students" in the School of Power and Mechanical.

My research interest has shifted from First-principles calculations in semiconductors to **Bio-inspired robot design, locomotion, robotic grasping, and manipulation**. 
You can find my CV here: [CV](../Resume_RuijiaZhang.pdf).

- I investigated the effect of strain on the bandgap and effective mass tunability of Œ≤-Ga2O3 using the GGA+U method based on density functional theory.
- The indirect-direct bandgap transition and electron mobility anisotropy in Œ≤-Ga2O3 under strain were discovered, suggesting potential applications of strain engineering in modulating its electronic properties.

**Ruijia Zhang**, Wenke Zhou, Zibin Nian, Ning Luo, Xiaoya He.

[**Project**](https://youtu.be/oTg_eVXxm2c)
-  I designed a double-joint fish robot driven by a coupling propulsion mechanism, with functions including straightening, turning, sinking and floating, and autonomous underwater cruising.
-  Underwater experiments and CFD simulation were established to study the relationship between swimming speed and mechanism design/driving parameters.

Team Leader, supervised by Prof. Min Li, WHU

**Ruijia Zhang**, Wenke Zhou, Zibin Nian

[**Project**](https://youtu.be/gkrrsqVv6eA)
- I designed and produced an integrated thermodynamic vehicle powered by the Stirling engine and completed the closed-loop obstacle avoidance trajectory with a purely mechanical structure. Through fine-tuning mechanisms and CNC machining, the trajectory accuracy is improved by 50%.
- Our team shattered the university record by winning the National Gold Award (1.43%).
- I served as a teaching assistant in a boot camp based on this project, training students in basic engineering skills.
